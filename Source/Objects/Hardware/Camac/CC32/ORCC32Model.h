There are two "features" of the ARE PCI-CAMAC hardware to
be aware of:

The hardware as delivered may come configured for use with
MS-DOS and force all memory accesses to lie below 1MB. This
will not work for either Mac or Win OSs and must be changed
using the PLX tools for re-programming the EEPROM on board
the PCI card.

The PCI-CAMAC hardware forces all NAF command writes to set
the F16 bit to a 1 and all NAF command reads to set the F16
bit to 0.  Therefore all F values from F0 through F15 MUST
be used with CAMAC bus read accesses and all F values from
F16 through F31 MUST be used with CAMAC bus write accesses.


At times delays must be used between a sequence
of NAF commands or the CC32 status returns
will not reflect the current status - but usually
that of the previous NAF command.  (See the
									CCamacContrlCC32Test object.)  This may possibly
be due to the design of the controller hardware, 
the speed of the PowerMac G4, or to the use of an
optimizing compiler which may relocate memory
accesses.   In an effort to alleviate this problem
all variables used to access PCI-CAMAC memory spaces
are declared volatile.
